		//! Since what is being compared here has been misunderstood, let me explain exactly what is going on and why the comparisons are set up the way they are. Firstly, this isn't something Regex can do, so don't take their results too seriously. A negating parser matches and consumes anything not the pattern. Matches and consumes. And. The closest you can get in Regex to this is to negate each individual character. A negative lookahead has been suggested a few times here, but a lookahead only matches, it does not consume, which is far different behavior. Again, do not take the Regex results very seriously.

		// This isn't exactly a token negation, but is as close as you're gonna get from Regex
		public static readonly Regex msregex = new Regex("^[^H][^e][^l][^l][^o]");

		// This isn't exactly a token negation, but is as close as you're gonna get from Regex
		public static readonly Regex msregexCompiled = new Regex("^[^H][^e][^l][^l][^o]", RegexOptions.Compiled);

		// This isn't exactly a token negation, but is as close as you're gonna get from Regex
		public static readonly PcreRegex pcreregex = new PcreRegex("^[^H][^e][^l][^l][^o]");

		// This isn't exactly a token negation, but is as close as you're gonna get from Regex
		public static readonly PcreRegex pcreregexCompiled = new PcreRegex("^[^H][^e][^l][^l][^o]", PcreOptions.Compiled);

		public static readonly Parser<Char, Unit> pidgin = Parser.Not(Parser.String("Hello"));

		// This isn't exactly a token negation, as it behaves more closely to a negative lookahead in Regex.
		public static readonly Sprache.Parser<Object> sprache = Parse.String("Hello").Not();

		public static readonly Pattern stringier = Not("Hello");
